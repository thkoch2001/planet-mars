Simple successor to Planet Venus but in Rust and maintained.

Please see the rustdoc of main.rs for further information.

## Todo

* find and use a nice lib to process the config file
  * should check whether dirs exists and are writeable
  * should check whether feed urls can be parsed

## Planet Venus

Planet Venus is used by many planets on the internet. However its code has not
been maintained since ~2011 and it uses Python 2.

Planet Mars should be a lightweight successor to Planet Venus.

Still the Planet Venus documentation contains some useful information on
[Etiquette](https://intertwingly.net/code/venus/docs/etiquette.html) for
Planet hosters.
